# Cognexa Community

> **A shared system of judgment for AI‑assisted work.**

Cognexa Community is the open, public commons for the **Cognexa
cognitive governance system**.\
It exists to capture, refine, and share *how experienced practitioners
think*---so that AI‑assisted work can be done intentionally, defensibly,
and at scale.

This is not a prompt library.\
This is not an agent marketplace.\
This is not about speed.

This is about **judgment**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Why Cognexa Community Exists

AI has made execution cheap and abundant.\
What it has *not* made cheap is **knowing what should be done, when, and
under what constraints**.

Most failures in AI‑assisted work don't come from bad tools---they come
from: - unclear intent - missing requirements - unspoken assumptions -
skipped decision points - and work starting before thinking is complete

Cognexa Community exists to solve that problem by making **thinking
reusable**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Who We Built This For

Cognexa Community is built for people who are already accountable for
outcomes:

-   Senior engineers and architects\
-   Platform and infrastructure leaders\
-   Technical consultants and VARs\
-   Auditors, assessors, and assurance professionals\
-   Practitioners working in regulated or high‑risk domains

If you've ever said: \> "We shouldn't have started building yet."\
\> "We missed a decision we should have documented."\
\> "AI moved fast, but we lost control."

You're in the right place.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What Lives in the Community

Cognexa Community is a **library of governance artifacts**, not code.

### Intents

Reusable templates for framing work correctly before execution begins.

### Gates

Explicit decision checkpoints that must be passed before work is allowed
to proceed.

### Contracts

Structured expectations for SDLC artifacts (PRDs, TRDs, VRDs, ASDs,
security add‑ons).

### Standards & Anti‑Patterns

Hard‑earned lessons from real projects---what to enforce, what to avoid,
and why.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## How This Fits into Cognexa

Cognexa is a **cognitive governance system**.\
Sophia is the authority that governs intent, gates, and decisions.

The community provides shared starting points.\
Sophia enforces them locally or in enterprise environments.

Nothing in this repo executes work.\
Everything in this repo governs whether work should happen at all.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Who We Are

Cognexa Community is stewarded by **Thalamus**.

Thalamus builds systems that sit above execution---systems concerned
with reasoning, judgment, governance, and accountability.

We are not here to replace humans with AI.\
We are here to make sure AI operates within human intent.

## Design Principles

-   Governance first\
-   Artifacts over chat\
-   Immutability over revisionism\
-   Human authority\
-   OSS credibility

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Contribution Model

-   Git‑based contributions
-   Required metadata and rationale
-   Versioned and hashed artifacts
-   Maintainer review
-   No anonymous publishing

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What This Is Not

This is not a prompt exchange, agent directory, or productivity forum.

This is the place for **how professionals think when the stakes are
real**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## One Sentence Summary

**Cognexa Community turns individual judgment into shared, enforceable
practice---so AI‑assisted work stays intentional, auditable, and
human‑led.**
